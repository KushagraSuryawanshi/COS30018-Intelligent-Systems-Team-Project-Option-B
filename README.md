## Testing Branch for Gray Scaling and Binarisation
- Makes use of the OpenCV library for both the grayscaling and the binarisation of images. A sample image is added for demonstration purposes and is displayed via the matplotlib library.

## Notes:
- This branch's purpose is to display research onto preproccessing methods.
- Name and purpose of branch may be altered.
