This week's implementation tests the loading of images from a given file path directory in Google Colab. 
The image is normalised by applying different transformations, these include Greyscale, ToTensor which converts the 
loaded image to a PIL Image, and Normalize which is used to standardise the tensor image with mean and standard deviation.
